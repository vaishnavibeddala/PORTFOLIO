** The portfolio is designed using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript (via Ionicons). It showcases my skills, projects, and contact details in a visually appealing and responsive layout. Each section — Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact — is styled with individual background images and smooth scroll navigation. This website not only highlights my journey and technical abilities but also reflects my creative approach to web design and user experience.
The Projects section features two major projects that I’m proud of. The first is a Real-Time Chat App, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Socket.IO. It demonstrates my understanding of real-time communication and dynamic user interfaces. The second project is this very portfolio website, which serves as both a live project and a personal branding tool. I’ve used subtle animations, box shadows, section-based backgrounds, and structured layouts to keep it clean and modern.
